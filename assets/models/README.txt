3D Models Directory
==================

Place your 3D model files here:
- .glb (recommended format)
- .gltf
- .obj with .mtl

For best performance on mobile:
- Keep models under 5MB
- Use compressed textures
- Optimize polygon count (< 50k triangles)
- Use Draco compression for GLB files

Example models can be found at:
